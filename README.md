# Customer_Segmentation
K-Means clustering is used to segment types of customer in a mall.

## About:

1. We check for the missing values, but there is none in our data set.
2. Then we will find WCSS( within clusters sum of squares) value for different number of clusters.
3. By plotting the data we can get the elbow point which is giving us the optimum number of clusters = 5.
4. Then we will train the k-means clustring model.
5. After plotting the clustors with there centroids we can analyse the reasults.
