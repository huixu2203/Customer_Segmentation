# Customer_Segmentation
K-Means clustering is used to segment types of customers in a mall.

## About:

1. We check for missing values, but there are none in our data set.
2. Then we will find the WCSS( within cluster sum of squares) value for different numbers of clusters.
3. By plotting the data, we can get the elbow point, which is giving us the optimum number of clusters, which is 5.
4. Then we will train the k-means cluster model.
5. After plotting the clusters with their centroids, we can analyse the results.
